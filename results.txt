directory in local development mode. You can run it from the root
directory of the project or from any subdirectory.

See 'meteor help <built-in command>' for details on a command.

Passing '--inspect' or '--inspect-brk' to 'meteor run', 'meteor test', or
'meteor test-packages' will enable debugging of the server process.

Other Commands:

Meteor also bundles 'node' and 'npm' by default. If you use the
commands 'meteor node' or 'meteor npm', you will be running
the same versions of 'node' and 'npm' that Meteor uses internally.

Other commands can be installed in the same directory as 'node' and
'npm' and used in all apps using the same version of Meteor. The
easiest way to install such commands is to add a global npm package
('yarn', 'jsdoc', etc.) that provides the command:

    meteor npm install --global <package name>

Any executable program(s) added by this command can be invoked just
like 'meteor node' or 'meteor npm' (for example, 'meteor yarn'):

    meteor <other command> [args]

Note that you may need to reinstall these commands after updating to
a different version of Meteor.
